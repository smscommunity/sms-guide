# IL Rules
These rules apply to the main tab, **ILs**; other tabs loosely abide by these but their rules are informal and have some deviations. Check example videos from the sheet you're interested in and ask in the Discord's #help channel if still unclear.

Rules are non-italicised and *guidelines (on best practices) are italicised*.

1. **Platform rules**: ILs may be run on Wii/GameCube (Nintendont or Swiss), or Dolphin emulator. They must be run:
    1. **On 60Hz** (if you are on PAL, ensure 60Hz is enabled by holding B during startup with intro skip practice code off; NTSC is always 60Hz).
    2. **Never using save-states to reset** (use the level select practice code and e.g. exit area).

2. **Permitted practice codes**: all codes are generally allowed, but some levels have specific restrictions **posted in the note on the level's name**. Specific rules:
    1. **Free Pause** is allowed but midair pausing is banned.
    2. **Fast Text (DPad Functions)** is allowed except for Pianta 5 Full, Secret and Reds.
    3. **Remove Saveboxes** is no longer available so just assume it's banned!
    4. **Any Fruit Opens Yoshi Eggs** is always allowed.
    5. **FMV Skips** is allowed but skipping cutscenes by pressing a button (i.e. not exit area) is banned specifically in Pinna 1.
    6. **Position Store/Load (DPad Functions)** is allowed specifically outside the part of the level being timed – usually to set up a starting position.
    7. **Fix Manta Splitting** is required for Sirena 1.

3. **Timer**: all times must be **obtained directly from the in-game timer** (IGT) provided by the **Shine Get Timer** (SGT) practice code, version 2 or later (from Oct 2019), *with two exceptions:* (1) SGT may be left off for ILs using vanilla IGT, and (2) runs may be retimed (as below). Consult example videos to see where time starts and ends for a given level.
    1. **Retimes may be requested** by typing `/ticket create` in the SMS discord. The included video must be somewhat cropped (i.e. <5 mins long). Examples of common retime situations are ILs from full-game runs or done without fast text by accident.
    2. **Retimes are available for all levels except** those where accurate load timing hasn't been done by the community, namely `Bianco 2; Ricco 1; Pinna 1; Noki 3,8; Airstrip; Corona Mountain (Full)`.

4. **Video requirement**:
    1. **Video is required for times in the top 3 and/or top 15% of a level leaderboard**. The cutoff times for each level are shown in a row at the top of the sheet. Any PB that can't be posted because of this should go in a note over the relevant cell. Runs in the top 15% but not top 10% without video may be accepted on appeal.
    2. ***Videos are encouraged for every IL**. Videos legitimise runs, show respect for the competition, and provide documentation/ideas for all to learn from, at all skill-levels/parts of the leaderboard.*

5. **Video validity criteria:** every link must be to a valid video, "valid" meaning: 
    1. The video **must include the entire run while the timer is running**. The timer runs during the load into any of the seven worlds (e.g. Bianco Hills), and therefore **the entire intro cutscene** is required for valid video.
    2. *The video ideally includes everything from the input that reset the level (and the ensuing load) to at least 2 seconds after the timer stops at the end.*
    3. The time shown on the in-game timer in the video **matches the time reported on the sheet**.
    4. The video is of **sufficient quality and without major frame-drops** (per mod discretion). The standard for this is higher for top-3 times. **Post-processed videos of gameplay** are **not** permitted, and the gameplay **must take up greater than or equal to 50% of the canvas in both width and height** of the video.
    5. The video must be on YouTube/Twitch for top-3 times, *and should be for any other submission if possible*. Top-3 videos on other platforms will be moved to a note.
    6. *Game audio should be present (though it needn't be the only audio).*
    7. *To link something that isn't a valid video, you may put it in a note – e.g. a link to a video of a worse time, or a still image. You may choose between reporting a worse time with link or a better one without – a choice between more points or a medal maybe – but it's nice to still keep the other time/video in a note.*

6. ***Deletions**: removal of submissions is discouraged, because the sheet aims to record all runs that are known to have happened, which also improves the accuracy of the points system.*

7. **Vandalism**: you may choose any colour for your name as long as it contrasts enough with the white background to be easily legible (it must give 2:1 or above on [this](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)), but may not change the formatting of anything else on the sheet *(Do you want your sheet to look like [this](https://bit.ly/2MLA3pK)? Didn't think so)*.
