# RTA Load Removal

*Due to variance in load times, a seperate timing method was created. This page can serve as a guide for converting traditional RTA timing into Loadless Timing.*

## Load Definition

A load is any point where the screen is pure black or white while preparing the next event. It isn't always obvious as to which which frames are pure black or white. Below are examples of transition frames between a load and an event. There are five major transistions that all act slightly differently: fades, circles, spirals, sweeps, and diamonds. There will only be one transition frame per load. The reason why they are all here is for reference in case the start or end loading frame is not clear.

### Fades

Fade outs are the trickiest, but thankfully they're only used for FMV movies and Noki Bay. There are 14 transition frames for most fades. The exception to this is Delfino Plaza loads from Noki Bay, which are 13 frames long.

## Loads per Run

In the current any% route there are 180 loads. There will be an extra load for each death that occurs, and two extra loads for each save-warp. Perceivably there might only be 161 with the use of hacked file as well as perfect cutscene mashing.
