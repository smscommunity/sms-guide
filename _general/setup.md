## Picking a Platform
In order to submit to the [official leaderboards](https://www.speedrun.com/sms), you need to play on one of the supported platforms:

- Nintendo Wii/Gamecube
- Super Mario 3D All Stars  
[**Recommended Hardware**](/sms-guide/setup#recommended-hardware)

These emulators are allowed for times slower than the threshold defined in the Category Rules:

- Dolphin Emulator
- Nintendont  
[**Emulator Guide**](/sms-guide/setup/emu)

There are small and large differences between the versions which will affect your speedruns. Find the full list of differences in our [version differences](https://smscommunity.github.io/sms-guide/game/versiondifferences) page.

## Leaderboard Verification
In order to have your run verified on our official leaderboards, there are a few rules:
- Runs must be real-time (No pausing the timer).
- Emulator and Nintendont is not allowed for runs faster than the threshold defined in the Category Rules.
- Video proof is required for runs faster than the threshold defined in the Category Rules.
- Videos are required to show the game clearly, and contain game audio.

### Thresholds
Video proof is required for runs faster than a designated and agreed upon time from the community per category. Each category has these times defined in the category rules. Example: Any% No ACE = 1:25:00 and better.

## Save Files
To submit to the official leaderboards, you will need to start on one of three files of your choice.
- New File
- Peach File (Start timer at 2:30.35)
- Hacked File (Start timer at 5:40.41)

## Recommended Hardware

There are four options you have to capture your game when playing on console. These are ordered from best to worst quality.  
- You can use component cables if your capture card allows for it, or if you have a Retrotink 5X.
- Its recommended (due to cost) and comparable to component to use a Wii2HDMI and an HDMI capture card.  
- You can use S-Video and it will be slightly better than RCA.
- The lowest quality option you have is RCA connection. (Yellow, red, and white plugs)
