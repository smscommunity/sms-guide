{: .no_toc }

## Picking a Platform
In order to submit to the [official leaderboards](https://www.speedrun.com/sms), you need to play on one of the supported platforms:

- Nintendo Wii/Gamecube
- Super Mario 3D All Stars

These emulators are allowed for times slower than the threshold defined in the Category Rules:

- Dolphin Emulator
- Nintendont

There are small and large differences between the versions which will affect your speedruns. Find the full list of differences in our [version differences](https://smscommunity.github.io/sms-guide/game/versiondifferences) page.

## Leaderboard Verification
In order to have your run verified on our official leaderboards, there are a few rules:
- Runs must be real-time (No pausing the timer).
- Emulator and Nintendont is not allowed for runs faster than the threshold defined in the Category Rules.
- Video proof is required for runs faster than the threshold defined in the Category Rules.
- Videos are required to show the game clearly, and contain game audio.

For tool to record your speedruns, check out our [tools](https://smscommunity.github.io/sms-guide/tools) page here.  

### Thresholds
Video proof is required for runs faster than a designated and agreed upon time from the community per category. Each category has these times defined in the category rules. Example: Any% No ACE = 1:25:00 and better.

## Save Files
To submit to the official leaderboards, you will need to start on one of three files of your choice.
- New File
- Peach File (Start timer at 2:30.35)
- Hacked File (Start timer at 5:40.41)

Find our guide on hacked file on our [tools](https://smscommunity.github.io/sms-guide/tools#speedrun-tools) page under speedrun tools.

## Recording  

There are three options you have to capture your game. These are ordered from best to worst quality.  
- You can use component cables if your capture card allows for it, or if you have a Retrotink 5X.
- Its recommended (due to cost) and comparable to component to use a Wii2HDMI and an HDMI capture card.  
- You can use S-Video and it will be slightly better than RCA.
- The lowest quality option you have is RCA connection. (Yellow, red, and white plugs)

### OBS Settings  
- Frame rate should be set to either 29.97 or 59.94 to reduce dropped/repeated frames. *Not 30/60fps*  
- Multiple audio tracks are useful in seperating discord, microphone, or music audio from the gameplay audio. [Tutorial Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1MjrylqbTc).  
- Replay buffer is used as a tool that records the previous designated seconds of gameplay using your RAM. It is extremely useful for recording ILs. Set at least 240s (4 minutes, around 100mb) or more depending on your IL times. If your replay buffer is running, when you complete an IL, you can hit the save button to the right and save the video instantly.
