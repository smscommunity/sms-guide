{: .no_toc }

## Picking a Platform
In order to submit to the [official leaderboards](https://www.speedrun.com/sms), you need to play on one of the supported platforms:

- Nintendo Wii/Gamecube
- Nintendo Switch/Switch2

[**Recommended Hardware**](/sms-guide/setup/hardware)

These emulators are allowed for times slower than the threshold defined in the [Category Rules](https://www.speedrun.com/sms?h=Any-gcn-no-ace&rules=category&x=n2y3r8do-j845md4n.gq7on0vl-ylqxgz78.1gn4rz8l):

- Dolphin Emulator (PC or other systems)
- Nintendont (Wii)

[**Emulator Guide**](/sms-guide/setup/emu)

There are small and large differences between the versions which will affect your speedruns. Find the full list of differences in our [version differences](https://smscommunity.github.io/sms-guide/game/versiondifferences) page.

## Leaderboard Verification
In order to have your run verified on our official leaderboards, there are rules:
- Runs must be real-time (No pausing the timer).
- Emulator and Nintendont is not allowed for runs faster than the threshold defined in the Category Rules.
- Video proof is required for runs faster than the threshold defined in the Category Rules.
- Videos are required to show the game clearly, and contain game audio.

### Thresholds
Video proof is required for runs faster than a designated and agreed upon time from the community per category. Each category has these times defined in the category rules. Example: Any% No ACE = 1:25:00 and better.

## Save Files
To submit to the official leaderboards, you will need to start on one of three files of your choice.
1. New File  
2. Peach File (Start timer at 2:30.35)
