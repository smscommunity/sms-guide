- Dont use the front USB ports, use the direct-to-motherboard back USB ports, and make sure they are at least USB 3.0
- Make sure you have the correct and updated drivers for your controller adapter, found [here](https://dolphin-emu.org/docs/guides/how-use-official-gc-controller-adapter-wii-u/)
- Make sure Vsync is off
- Play in fullscreen, and turn off borderless fullscreen
- Overclock your adapter, tutorial found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cQ3pbKZm_yUtcLK9ZIXyPzVbTJkvnfxKIyvuFMwzWe0/edit?tab=t.0)
