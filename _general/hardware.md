# Recommended Hardware

There are **four** options you have to capture your game when playing on console. These are ordered from best to worst quality.  
1. You can use component cables if your capture card allows for it, or if you have a Retrotink 5X.
2. Its recommended (due to cost) and comparable to component to use a Wii2HDMI and an HDMI capture card.  
3. You can use S-Video and it will be slightly better than RCA.
4. The lowest quality option you have is RCA connection. (Yellow, red, and white plugs)
