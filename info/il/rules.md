# ILs Sheet Rules
*These rules and guidelines apply equally to the spreadsheet tabs other than **ILs**, but aren't currently rigidly enforced.*

1. All **times must be recorded directly from the in-game timer** provided by the **Shine Get Timer** practice code, version 2 or later (from Oct 2019), *except* for any times that are retimed (from e.g. full-game runs or with the fast text code accidentally left off). Retimed times must be submitted to mods with a cropped video – for now, just post it somewhere in the Discord.

2. **Video proof is highly encouraged for every IL**, and expected for any top-3 time. Videos legitimise your times, show respect for your nearby competition, and provide useful documentation and ideas for others to learn from, at *all* skill-levels/parts of the leaderboard.

3. The **medals** (gold/silver/bronze) track the top 3 times that have valid video links. The **points** count the number of ILs you beat, plus one for your own IL – e.g. 1 point for last place, 2 for 2nd-to-last, etc – irrespective of video.

4. **Links should be used for valid videos**, as per these criteria:
    1. The link is a video of the IL (not a picture or a heavy-metal song 🤔).
    2. The time shown on the in-game timer (or logged in the retime sheet) in the video matches the time reported on the sheet to within 0.02, i.e. less than a frame.
    3. The video is mostly complete and without major frame-drops (per mod discretion).

5. If you want to link something that isn't a valid video, you may put it in a note – e.g. a link to a video of a worse time. You can choose between reporting a worse time with link or a better one without – a choice between more points or a medal maybe – but it's nice to keep the other time/video in a note.

6. All **practice codes are generally allowed**; some levels have specific restrictions **posted in the note on the level's name**, and you should check a video to see where timing starts. General rules:
    - **Free Pause** is allowed but midair pausing is banned.
    - **Fast Text** is allowed except for Pianta 5 Full and Secret.
    - **Any Fruit Opens Yoshi Eggs** is allowed.
    - **FMV Skips** is allowed but skipping cutscenes by pressing a button (i.e. not exit area) is banned in Pinna 1.
    - **DPad Functions (Store/Load Position)** is allowed specifically outside the part of the level being timed – usually to set up a starting position.
