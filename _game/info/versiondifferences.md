# Version Differences

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JX7U7is.jpeg" width="500">  

JP is faster than PAL by up to 3.5 seconds, and JP is more likely to hit early cycle in PV5 which saves an additional 15-20 seconds.

- Less fruits in the plaza.
- Getting off Yoshi allows clips, because you jump off Yoshi backwards, while in other versions it's more of a vertical dismount.
- Minimal amount of air damage frames.
- Subtitles always on.
- Japanese is the only available language.
- No Piantissimo music.
- Delfino music takes a bit to start.
- If you throw a fruit as you land, you can make the fruit float in mid-air.
- Opening cutscenes are voiced differently.
- When Shadow Mario shines spawn, as they fall they don't spin.
- Sound glitch has a chance of crashing the game, and remains until the game is reset. Other versions fix the sound glitch immediately and won’t crash the game.

- Language options are available (Italian being the fastest). (-5.44 seconds gained)
- Faster loads than NTSC-U, but slower than JP (+20.9 seconds lost).

#### Level Differences   
- Bianco 2 - The windmill blades turn slower.
- Pianta 1 - You cannot put the chomplets out with your hover nozzle. (~+1.5 seconds lost)
- Pianta 5 - Less likely to get early cycle due to textbox length.
- Pinna 1 - Rockets will not collide with each other.
- Pinna 3 - Electrokoopas are on different cycles, and you are put in a different animation state after being shocked, - preventing you from hovering and making it more possible to bonk. Harder to do the ending fast, but has a very minimal time lost (~+1 second lost). ~31 pace runs will be easier due to the Electrokoopa cycle.
- Pinna 5 - The ferris wheel moves slower.
- EYG - Fruit storage is possible. (~-2.5 seconds gained)
- Sirena 6 - Goop cleaned percentage requirement is more lenient. (~-5.5 seconds gained)

### NTSC-U (1.1)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HL9hgq9.jpeg" width="500">  

The slowest version since it is identical to PAL, but with no language options or fast fades, losing +19.65 seconds.  

### NTSC-K (1.1)

The Korean version, identical to NTSC-U but it can run on JP consoles.  

### 3D All-Stars (Switch)

The limited-edition Nintendo Switch version, which also includes Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy. Saves almost 2 minutes (-01:55.12) to loads over Japanese, but is glitchy and has worse controls. All these factors make it less competitive.

  </summary>

*by NokiDoki*  
#### v1.1.0 (Nov 16, 2020)
- GameCube controller is now supported with the original controls (but different stick calibration and rumble), Switch controllers are left unchanged.
- Camera controls can be changed in the (-) menu, for all controller types. There are 5 toggles allowing independent flipping of the camera's horizontal and vertical axes, Y cam's horizontal and vertical axes, and FLUDD's vertical aiming. Shortcuts are provided to quickly set the GC version's controls, or the default 3DAS controls.
- The map can only be buffered on Switch controllers but doing so on hotel/casino load still causes random polygons.
- FLUDD's tutorial still doesn't explain anything without subtitles. Subtitles and other in-game hints only mention Switch controls, regardless of the controller being used.
- Spray and underwater hover work like in the original on GC controller, but are still laggy on Switch controllers.
- There are no debug cubes in Bianco 6 anymore.
- The race start beep now sounds like in the original.
- The falling Pianta in Ricco 8 is gone.
- The screen effect from using the turbo nozzle underwater was removed entirely.
- Pinna rockets seem to always shoot straight with all controllers. On GC controller, you shoot them by pressing digital R, while on Switch controllers you shoot with either R or ZR. Buffered shots only work on Switch controllers.
- Laugh skip still only works in English, French and German.
- Sirena 6 timer can still end early.

#### v1.0.0 / v1.0.1 (Sept 18, 2020)  
- Nintendo and game logos depend on language (picked on the game selection screen)
- GC controller recognized as a Pro Controller but can't be remapped atm, so Y cam and all uses of L are inaccessible
- Soft reset (Start + X + B) still works
- Controls changed:
1. A and B both mapped to jump
2. Y mapped to dive
3. Press the right stick for Y cam
4. Camera controls are reversed, no way to flip them back
5. L for the map, ZL for ground pounds/sidestep/camera, R for digital spray (aim), ZR for analog spray (run)
- The map can now be opened and closed by holding L rather than pressing it. By holding L to repeatedly open and close the map, you can see consecutive quarter-frames, which was previously impossible without hacks. Buffering the map while the hotel or casino load will cause random polygons to appear.
- FLUDD's tutorial was spliced and only makes any sense if you read the subtitles (which can still be disabled)
- Spray and underwater hover don't come out instantly, it's always as if you took half a second to press R down: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaD6UUp0NFo
- Save boxes can't be avoided, except maybe by filling up the console's storage. Must scroll down twice and hit “Continue”.
- Load times are much faster than in the original, but there is noticeable lag, mainly on the plaza.
- The sound at the beginning of a race (Ricco 2 or Piantissimo) is... [different](https://twitter.com/GreatGonzales/status/1305792684204986368)
- A Pianta can be seen falling from the sky during the Ricco 8 intro. This was likely in the original but couldn't be seen in 4:3.
- One of the coins spawned by jumping under the cash register in Gelato disappears shortly after spawning.
- The screen effect from using the turbo nozzle underwater was left in 4:3 and doesn't reach the sides of the screen.
- Rockets in Pinna 1 and 8 can be shot by pressing or simply holding either R or ZR. They always shoot straight unless buffered (grab one while holding R or ZR to shoot it immediately)
- King Boo laugh skip only works in French, English and German, tbd whether or not this makes one of them faster than Italian
- The path to the windmill is occasionally already raised at the start of Bianco 1, with the Piranha Plant still active inside it
- Classic Dolphin glitches return, including Sirena 6 ending early and the debug cubes in Bianco 6
- Beside the glitch, Sirena 6 seems to have a stricter requirement than the GC versions
- While seemingly based on PAL, this version has a different memory layout to any of the GC ones, so anything that depends on memory layout (e.g. Chomplet aggro, Pianta 2 text skip, Pianta 5 reds fast text, etc.) may yield different result from those
