# Spam Sprays  

Spam sprays are a technique that the game doesn't tell you about, and comes wildly in handy in many different situations.  

### The difference between Analog and Digital  
On the Gamecube controller, there are two types of inputs on the triggers, analog and digital.

#### Digital Spam Sprays  

Digital Spam Sprays come out in a cylindrical cone straight out in front of you. They are done by pressing R and A together, with minimal spraying before the spam spray (less than 2 frames).

#### Analog Spam Sprays  

Analog Spam sprays come out at a slightly downturned angle and wider compared to digital spam sprays. They are done by spraying before pressing R and A together (at least 2 frames).

You can see the difference in spread of water particles between the gifs above. Each spam spray has its uses, a good example being in Shadow Mario Insta-Kills where a digital spam spray makes it easier.
