# Sign Strats (Fast Piantissimo Text)
There is a .6 timesave (each time you do it) found where if you read a sign during a Piantissimo race, his text appears instantly. It saves time because Piantissimo doesn't stop moving while you read a sign.  
*This trick has some nuance to it.*  

After the race starts, read the sign then close the textbox that pops up.  

Finish the race, then make sure to face within a **5-10 degree angle** of where Piantissimo lands and finishes the race.

Using the grass texture and the seam on the fence, you can line Mario up like so.  
**Make sure to not be too far back** or *you won't trigger Piantissimo's text* (and possibly dive off the edge).

Using the pole and the seam of the wall texture in the background, grab the pole, line them up and press B to let go. Walk forward until you are almost touching the flagpole.  
You can press A+B once you regain control of Mario, and bonk off and grab the shine immediately.
