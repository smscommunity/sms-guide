# Rocket Rollouts  
Rocket Rollouts are a glitched movement form where you are able to rocket while rolling out. Rolling out is the fastest way Mario can move (without FLUDD) so this is a faster than rocket diving, and also has the benefit of letting you rocket repeatedly. You must hold A while in the air or else Mario will hit an invisible ceiling/height cap.
