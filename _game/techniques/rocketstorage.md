# Rocket Storage
Rocket Storage is a glitch that cancels the blast of the rocket with an animation from Mario, and then stores that vertical speed from your rocket. If you have stored speed, you cannot jump or move normally or you will overwrite the stored speed. You can only sidestep and keep your stored speed, in order to walk off a ledge activating your stored speed.  

When canceling the rocket and storing your speed, aim to do it near the end of Marioâ€™s animation rather than earlier. Canceling too early gives you less height and can lead to a limp rocket, while waiting until later preserves more speed and gives you a stronger launch.
