# Rocket Storage
Video Tutorial *by DutchJ*  
{% include yt.html id="g3U1UB9lSCM" %}  
Rocket Storage is a glitch that cancels the vertical speed from your rocket, by cancelling the blast of the rocket with an animation from Mario. If you store vertical speed, you cannot jump or move normally or you will remove the stored speed. You can only sidestep and keep your stored speed, in order to walk off a ledge activating your stored speed.
