# Yoshi Skip
Yoshi Skip is an optional trick that many beginners go for along with [Gelato Beach Skip](/sms-guide/techniques/maneuvers/gbs/) (GBS). It doesn't save as much time as GBS (only ~25 seconds), but players will go for it since it lets you do the standard route with Pianta as the 3rd world after Gelato in Any% (No ACE). Pianta is one of the hardest worlds in the game, so this is beneficial.

## Movement to the Mushroom
- Upon entry, hoverslide across the bridge. If you find the hoverslide inconsistent, you can walk forward while spraying then jump dive when the water reaches the bridge and slide
- Switch to hover nozzle and hold R while sliding. Steer left, then when Mario hovers, release R and press and hold A to full double jump left of the bridge, carrying the speed from the slide. Be careful not to bonk on the wall. 
- Hover to the grate, then dive rollout and hoverslide rollout to the mushroom below. Alternatively, a bellyhop can be used instead of the rollout hoverslide
- Spin jump and hover to the next mushroom, then spin jump dive to the green mushroom and perform a small rollout to land on the sloped section of the mushroom, allowing Mario to carry his momentum into his next spin jump.  Alternatively, a spin jump and hover can be used instead of the spin jump dive and rollout
- Spin jump and hover to the green spotted mushroom and perform yoshi skip

- Briefly fall, then hover backwards to ledgegrab the mushroom in the red square.
- Press B to wallslide, then shortly after Mario releases from the wall and starts falling, begin hovering.
- Either hover backwards into the mushroom or turn Mario around and hover forward
- Once clipped inside the mushroom, release R and fall into the loading zone
