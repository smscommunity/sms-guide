# Bianco Plant
You have a few approaches to unlocking the plant that you can do:
#### Normal Movement
*Beginner*  
- Hoverslide straight forward
- Veer to the left to avoid bonking on the benches
- Right as you pass the last bench, do a small rollout just past the tree
- Turn the camera right and hoverslide straight towards the plant
- As you approach the plant and get in the mud, hold R with the spray nozzle out
- Bonk into the plant and spray it

#### 2014 TAS Movement
*Intermediate*  
Saves ~0.9s over Normal Movement  
- Tilt the camera to the right and hoverslide past the Blue Pianta
- As you pass the Pianta, veer the waterslide to the left
- Rollout as you pass the bananas
- Dive to the right, rollout and hit Y at the same time, and spray while rolling out.
- Aim in an arc hitting the plant
- After about 2.5s of spraying, tap Y to get out of Y-Cam and backflip forward

#### Roof "Scumbag" Movement
*Intermediate*  
Saves ~0.5s over 2014 TAS Movement  
- Tilt the camera to the right and hoverslide past the Blue Pianta
- Rollout as you pass the Orange Pianta on the right
- Do a landing spinjump out of your rollout
- Hover (for as short as possible) as you become high enough to land on the awning, and dive onto the awning
- Again, hover as you become high enough to get onto the roof, and dive onto the roof
- When you rollout, hold A for a long rollout, making sure to avoid this part of the roof:

- As you land on the red roof, press A+Y to jump and start spraying, aim just above the horizon so you spray the plant early
- Slowly aim up as you fall, keeping the stream of water hitting the plant
- After ~2.5s after you started spraying, un Y-Cam and backflip dive forward
