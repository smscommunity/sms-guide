# Pianta Early

Pianta Village's entrance is a red pipe high on top of the Shine Gate. This is difficult to climb for a casual without the use of either Yoshi (requires Pinna 4 shine) or a rocket (30 shines).

#### Triple Jump
*Beginner/Intermediate*  
- Hoverslide forwards and slightly to the left, take care to not reenter the M behind you
- Hover into the wall and do a landing spinjump, or buffer a running spinjump into the wall and spinjump, up through the awning
- Bounce up and dive once you rise above the roof
- Rollout onto the green roof, holding forward and preserving your momentum into your running speed
- Jumpdive onto the yellow roof, and do an instant momentum spinjump off the tip of the roof. Hover at the peak of your jump to avoid a ledgegrab on the white ledge.
  - *Alternatively, you can also simply wallkick off the white part of the shine gate.*
- Do a triple jump *with some speed* and hover at the peak of your jump
- Turn around and ledgegrab the Shine Gate

#### Spinjump + Y-Turn
*Beginner/Intermediate*  
- Hoverslide forwards and slightly to the left, take care to not reenter the M behind you
- Hover into the wall and do a landing spinjump, or buffer a running spinjump into the wall and spinjump, up through the awning
- Bounce up and dive once you rise above the roof
- Rollout onto the green roof, holding forward and preserving your momentum into your running speed
- Jumpdive onto the yellow roof, and do an instant momentum spinjump off the tip of the roof. Hover at the peak of your jump to avoid a ledgegrab on the white ledge.
  - *Alternatively, you can also simply wallkick off the white part of the shine gate.*
- Jump and do a landing spinjump, and press Y very shortly after your jump. *Not at the same time*
  - Its important to finish spinning just before you land, so you are holding forward and let Mario run for at least one frame to have enough speed/height. [More details on spinjumps](/sms-guide/techniques/spinjumps/)
- Right when you enter Y-Cam, hold left to turn and once you reach a 45Â° angle to the wall, press Y to exit Y-Cam then hold A to wallkick (or double tap A holding the second press, but using Y to exit Y-Cam provides the best muscle memory for infinite wallkicks
- Hover backwards onto the Shine Gate

#### Spinjump + Y-Turn Variant (dive rollout)
*Intermediate*  
- Same as Spinjump + Y-Turn, but you do a dive and a small rollout on the white ledge of the Shine Gate. Saves about 0.6s.
