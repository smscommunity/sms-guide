# Instakills (and Quick Kills)  

**Instakills** are when you instantly down Shadow Mario with a *point-blank spam spray*, and there are many different setups for each kill in order to get enough speed and the right position in order to pull it off.  

**Quick kills** are when you otherwise down Shadow Mario with your *spray nozzle (usually from a distance)*.  

Instakill/quick kill setups vary, and are described on each respective [Shines](/sms-guide/shines/) page. Since there is no where we can reasonably insert Delfino Shadow Mario tutorials (no shine involved), they will be on this page.  

## Bianco Rising  

#### Quick Kill 
{% include yt.html id="Zt72DgCMRr4" %}  


- Hover slide over to Shadow Mario
- Optimally you can slide through the goop then jump dive as shown in the video, or you can rollout over the M and waterslide again towards Shadow Mario.
- Rollout and make sure to land a reasonable distance away from Shadow Mario (you want to walk into his trigger)
- Spray while running straight
- As long as you down Shadow Mario before where the sun starts/the shade ends, you will save ~8 seconds. The farther he goes, the more time you lose.

#### Instakill
{% include yt.html id="G2rw4aWcpxY" %}  


- Again, sliding through the M is faster
- This time you want to do an instant hoverslide out of the goop (again you can alternatively rollout over the goop and start a new hoverslide)
- Aim just to the left of Shadow Mario
- As your nozzle is about to touch his feet, press Digital R and A together (make sure to try not to press Analog R, you want a fast R press as shown in the video)
- Optimally you want a 1 frame A press as well for the smallest jump to trigger the text ASAP

#### Quick Kill
{% include yt.html id="q8_1FvsuuYE" %}  


- This video is an IL, so they approach Shadow Mario rather aggressively here. For RTA, a suggestion would be to approach from further from the right.
- Spray Shadow Mario while keeping your distance. Once he starts to line up with the tree, jump and do a couple [digital spam sprays](/sms-guide/techniques/spamsprays/) (analog spam sprays will angle further downwards, likely missing the banana).
- Dive into your water and rollout, buffering a B grab into the banana if possible (or just dive into it while holding b).
- Either run or throw the banana over to Yoshi depending on how close he is.
- Do a spin jump off same spot in the grass texture to get a clean triple jump and eat the pineapple.


#### Instakill
{% include yt.html id="uI-xscpEras" %}  


- Same setup as the last video, but you spot spraying Shadow Mario slightly earlier, and do a digital spam spray rollout over him to down him instead.
