# GWK/D/H

## GWK
The *glitchy wall kick* (GWK) is a wallkick that sends you in the **opposite** direction of the angle you **would have gone** with a normal wallkick. It is performed by pressing Y then A. You have a 2 frame window for these inputs. Press A on the frame after the Y press, or the frame after that. This is typically done by rolling your thumb from Y to A, easiest on the Gamecube controller due to the button placements.     

If you press Y before you wallslide, you override that reflection and it acts as a normal wallkick.  

## GWKD
The *glitchy wall kick dive* (GWKD) is the same as a **GWK** but you want to press B as well as A, giving you a dive.  
Used in [Pianta 3 Advanced Strat](https://smscommunity.github.io/sms-guide/shines/pianta/episode3/#advanced---normal-boost-gwkd) and others.  

## GWKH
The *glitchy wall kick hover* (GWKH) is the same as a **GWK** but you cancel the Y-Cam immediately with a hover input. This is different compared to GWKD because you want to press R slightly later depending on the situation.  
Used in [Bianco 2 Advanced Strat mounting the windmill](https://smscommunity.github.io/sms-guide/shines/bianco/episode2/#y-turn-wall-kicks) and others.
