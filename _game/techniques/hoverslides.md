# Hoverslides

The most common form of movement among top runners, you spray the hover nozzle then dive into the puddle of water to get an instantaneous water slide, starting the slide earlier and reaching higher speed faster. 

Tips to reduce dryslides:
- Spray the hover nozzle for at least two frames.
- Make sure FLUDD is awake. (Nozzle is facing forward, not relaxed and back)
- Spray the normal nozzle first, this puts water in front of you and also wakes FLUDD up.
