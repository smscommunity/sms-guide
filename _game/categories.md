SMS speedrunners play in 5 main disciplines.

## Any% (No ACE)

Beat the final boss starting from a fresh file, timed in real time. The requirement for unlocking the final boss is beating episode 7 in all 7 worlds (excluding the hub world). This usually involves collecting 44 shines.

### Skips
The shines can be done in the intended order, except for 5 skips that are usually used:
1. **Bianco 1 Skip**  
This shine is easily accessible in episode 1, so the Bianco 1 shine is always skipped.
2. **[Gelato Beach Skip](https://smscommunity.github.io/sms-guide/shines/gelato/episode8) (GBS)**  
Collecting the Gelato 8 shine during Episode 1 lets you access episode 7 right after, and so swaps episodes 1–7 in Gelato Beach with episodes 7–8, saving ~12 minutes. Alternatively, you can play episodes 1–7 as normal.
3. **Pianta Early**  
Pianta Village can be accessed at any time using a couple of methods to climb to its entrance without rocket or Yoshi. This is usually done in Any%; alternatively, you can visit this world later, after unlocking either the rocket (requires 30 shines) or Yoshi (requires Pinna 4 shine).
4. **[Yoshi Skip](https://smscommunity.github.io/sms-guide/shines/pianta/yoshiskip/)**  
Pianta 5 as intended requires Yoshi to complete, but is usually done without Yoshi using this technique. Alternatively, do Pianta after unlocking Yoshi (requires Pinna 4 shine).
5. **[Early Yoshi-Go-Round](https://smscommunity.github.io/sms-guide/shines/pinna/eyg/) (EYG)**  
Pinna 5 is usually skipped by accessing Pinna 6 secret from an earlier episode (usually 3 or 5). Yoshi is used so this must be done after Pinna 4, which unlocks it. Alternatively, do Pinna 5–6 as intended.

## 120 Shines
Any% (No ACE) with the additional requirement of collecting 120 shines (= 96 physical shines + 240 blue coins) and beating the final boss as the final shine.
