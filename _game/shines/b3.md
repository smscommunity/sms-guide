# Bianco 3
Bianco 3 is made up of two parts: the Entry and the Secret.
## Entry
Both the Beginner and Advanced strats utilize a majority of the same movement. The one difference will be called out in the Advanced section.
### Beginner
#### Pole Wall Kick
- From the start, hold up and hoverslide
- Aim towards roughly the middle of the log and buffer a hover by holding R
- Briefly hover when Mario slides off the path and double jump off the log
- Depending on the speed retained from the double jump, you may need to dive rollout to reach the doorway
- Dive through the doorway, rollout, then jump and spray up the path. Dive into the water left on the path
- Slide to the water, rollout onto the first log, jump dive to the second log
- Rollout onto the land, dive rollout up the small hill to position yourself to the right of the pole
- Spin jump or sideflip into the pole to begin the wall kick
- Aim to the [right side of the pole](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/941086197885833266/1029200667119730708/unknown.png) as Mario can only wall kick off the right side.
- Hover up to the cliff, dive rollout into the steep section while holding R to buffer a hover
- Hover up the steep section, then jump dive and rollout into the secret
