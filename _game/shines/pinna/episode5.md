# Pinna 5
Pinna 5 is a shine not required for any% completion due to EYG; however, EYG can be quite intimidating for a new runner and it's not required for the standard any% route. Pinna 5 is an overall very simple level and highly recommended when starting out.

#### Tree Triple
*Beginner*  
- Start by hoversliding towards the right side of the light blue awning until you pass under it and reach the leftmost red and yellow awning.
- Spinjump into a hoverdive onto the awning, then charge a spinput as soon as mario bounces off of it.
- Mash or Time an A input to triple jump off of the tree, then hover into a dive rollout off of the green mesh platform.
- Spinjump then hover cancel to the right, leading into a buffered spinjump dive towards the green mesh ramp, then rolling out onto it to get a lot of momentum.
- As you reach the top of the ramp, do a full A press jump off of it towards the left then start hovering towards the ferris wheel and you'll clip right through the wheel. (It is VITAL that you start the hover pretty late, otherwise you'll have too much height and run into an invisible wall that prevents you from clipping through the wheel. The height required to avoid this invisible wall is very lenient so don't worry about this too much.)
- As you clip through the ferris wheel, aim for the platform just under the mesh platform that the electrokoopa is sleeping on, then spinjump off it and hover, effectively grabbing the ceiling. Press A to flip mario through the mesh door and this will kill the electrokoopa, spawn the shine, then bring the ferris wheel's speed back to normal.
- Jump to the platform just left of the mesh, then charge a beyblade and beyblade spin off its slope to land one of the ferris wheel cabins (if this beyblade is too hard for you, just do a normal buffered spin, it barely loses any time)
- As you reach the top, charge another beyblade, then spinjump dive off the ferris wheel cabin and rollout into the shine

#### Boat Beyblade
*Advanced*  
- Start by hoversliding just left of the clams until you reach the rightmost red and yellow awning, then spinjump dive onto the awning.
- Start hovering towards the left where the closest boat is going to end up, then land on the left side of the boat.
- Charge a beyblade and then beyblade off of the boat as the boat starts to become steep enough for buttslide momentum.
- Staying spinning in midair to preserver momentum then hover into a dive rollout as you reach the green mesh ramp.
- Run up the ramp with the momentum you received from the rollout and then do a full A press jump off of the ramp and hover towards the ferris wheel, effectively clipping through it (again, heeding the warning to hover late to avoid the invisible wall)
- As you're clipping through the ferris wheel, dive rollout off of the top of the brick wall, then buffer spinjump off the platform just under the mesh that the electrokoops is sleeping on, effectively grabbing the ceiling, then press A to flip mario through the mesh door and this will kill the electrokoopa, spawn the shine, then bring the ferris wheel's speed back to normal.
- The beyblade to the cabin is the same as it is in the beginner video.
- As you reach the shine platform, do a backflip onto the shine platform, then do an extra dive into a ground pound, collecting the shine.
