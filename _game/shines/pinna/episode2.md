# Pinna 2  

Pinna 2 you skip Monty Mole's bomb fight (done in Noki 1) and do a straight forward secret that is cycle locked.  
<i> [Unless you're TAS](https://youtu.be/0g05eemtAwo) </i>    

### Mole Skip  
Dive correctly into Monty Mole right after he finishes either shooting bullets or throwing bombs, and you clip right through him into the secret loading zone.  

#### Backflip 
*Recommended*

#### Spinjump

### The Secret  
#### Safe

#### Trampoline Skip 
*Risky and unnecessary in RTA because of cycle*
