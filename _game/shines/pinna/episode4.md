# Pinna 4

Pinna 4 is a commonly disliked shine. Water droplet RNG, Mario's position, and avoiding damage inflicted by the Snooza Koopas can all affect whether you can hit a successful one cycle.

### Video Explanation

### One cycle vs two cycle strats
A "cycle" in Pinna 4 refers to when a player is forced to watch the "flower restoration/healing" cutscene until the large flower spawns the Shine Sprite.
After any single Snooza Koopa is fully eliminated (disappears), the player will have a short window to act until the cutscene triggers.
- Ideally you want to eliminate all five Snooza Koopas before the cutscene triggers. This is a one cycle.
- An easier strat involves eliminating 3 Koopas during one cycle, then eliminating the 2 remaining ones in a second cycle.
- A backup one cycle may involve eliminating 4 Koopas in one cycle or any combination of 5 Koopas in two cycles.

- Each Snooza Koopa must be sprayed for a certain lenght of time to be awakened.
- When a Snooza Koopa wakes up, you can hear a "popping" sound. Use this audio cue to confirm how many Koopas are awake.
- You must properly aggro the Snooza Koopas so that they land on the sand. If they land on grass, they won't be vulnerable to attack.
- If at any point you take damage from a Snooza Koopa, you will reset their aggro and must get their attention again UNLESS they have begun to attack.
- A Snooza Koopa begins their attack once they shuffle their fins on the sand, which is both an audio and visual cue.
- After eliminating a few Koopas, the remaining Koopas will become vulnerable for less time than the previous ones (the fight becomes harder).

### Strat Demos
Watch these videos and make note of where these runners position Mario for each step.
#### Two Cycle (3-2)

#### One Cycle (Right Side)  
*Intermediate*

#### One Cycle (Left Side)  
*Intermediate, potentially faster*

#### One Cycle (Left Side, GP Damage Cancel)
*Advanced*

*Final tips*
- You can delay your groundpound on the first Snooza Koopa to give you more leniency in eliminating the remaining Koopas. This sacrifices speed for lower difficulty.
- In between cycles, if a Koopa is awake and aggros on you, Mario can be pushed towards the water by a Koopa. Stay away from the remaining Koopas to avoid this.
