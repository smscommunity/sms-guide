# Pinna 7
Like the other episode seven shines, Pinna 7 features a Shadow Mario chase sequence. The most useful technique to know for this shine is spam spraying. Every other Shadow Mario has 100 health, but the one in this level has 150. So, be prepared to spray a little more than usual. Most players use the beginner strat as it is highly consistent due to having lenient timing, and loses less than a second to the advanced strat.
### Entrance
{% include yt.html id="YDxrxFj0Jv0" %}
Entering the park is the same as pinna 1 and 3:
-Jumpdive as soon as Mario hits the ground.
-Instead of performing a rollout, bellyhop (press B) directly after which leads into a waterslide.

To get though the entrance with a single slide requires some maneuvering between obstacles. The image above highlights two main points to avoid bonking off of. The easiest way to do this is by first leaving a bit of space between Mario and the wall. After sliding past the forward facing section of the wall, you can then hold the control stick forward and in toward the wall. Once Mario is sliding against the side you should be able to slide through freely without bonking. Notice that holding in towards the walls also help to avoid bonking on the further ahead wall and noki at the entrance.
### Beginner (Left Side)

Notice that there is no intro cutscene to mash through when loading into the park. This means you can start moving Mario during the fade in.

-Walk Mario forawrd to the spot in the first image.
-Once you reach this point, jump dive and rollout.
(Make sure to jump dive over the stairs, as rolling out on them often results in bonking or instantly standing up, which loses a lot of speed).
-The timeframe to move the camera is lax, and can be completed anytime from directly before jumodiving until the rollout.
-The camera required for this is to center it directly between the Electro-Koopa and railing of the Yoshi-Go-Round.
-After the rollout, continue walking directly behind Shadow Mario.
-You should not need to change the camera much after this, and can walk mostly in a straight line.
-It is easiest to spam spray Shadow Mario when they are double jumping.
-It will likely take two or three well timed spam sprays to deplete Shadow Mario's health due the 50 extra points.
-After Shadow Mario completes the triple jump, they will be able to be downed.
-Even if all of Shadow Mario's health is gone, you still need to wait to spray them on the ground for them to fall down.
-Once you have talked with Shadow Mario the shine will spawn.
-The Electro-Koopas will likely try to pester you while the shine is still spawning, and there are two ways to deal with them:
1. Stand where the shine will spawn and move the camera such that both Electro-Koopas are off screen.
2. Stand where the shine will spawn and enter Y-Camera mode. Spray the Electro-Koopas to prevent them from attacking you.
### Advanced (Right Side)
