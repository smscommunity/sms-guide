# Pinna 3
Pinna 3 is a highly technical level where you collect the red coins in the park.  

*This level has a **two** version differences.* 
- JP and NTSC-U/PAL have very slightly different ending electrokoopa cycles, *losing JP about **0.5s** at optimal level (31.xx IL time)*.
- You can hover after being shocked by an electrokoopa in **JP only**.

#### One Slide
-Tap jump, then dive.  
-Instead of performing a rollout, bellyhop (press B) directly after which leads into a waterslide.

To get through the entrance with a single slide requires some maneuvering between obstacles. The image above highlights two main points to avoid bonking off. The easiest way to do this is by first leaving a bit of space between Mario and the wall. After sliding past the forward-facing section of the wall, you can then hold the control stick forward and in toward the wall. Once Mario is sliding against the side you should be able to slide through freely without bonking. Notice that holding in towards the walls also help to avoid bonking on the further ahead wall and noki at the entrance.

- **NTSC-U/PAL**  
*You can run straight up the ramp past the electrokoopas, compared to having to zigzag on JP*

There are some different variations you can do for the TAS Strat detailed below.

    Coin Clip - Click for Details
  </summary>  
  Coin Clip (7th coin) is a difficult trick that saves around **2.0s** and is largely feel based. The edges of the ramps (the wood) do not have collision, allowing you to clip inside these green grates.  
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TH29lxn.png" width=500>  
  Coin Clip can be done on [Left Side](https://youtu.be/GdkqnhZPNO4?si=cDnymqSKw5t_RPgI&t=19) or [Right Side](https://youtu.be/gEY-LOqHxXg?si=is31hPOO3LBYfLNB&t=21) (preference).
