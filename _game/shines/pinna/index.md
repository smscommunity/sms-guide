### Park Entrance
{% include yt.html id="YDxrxFj0Jv0" %}
Entering the park is relevent for episodes 1, 3, 5, 6, 6R, 7, and 8.

#### One Slide
-Jump Dive as soon as Mario hits the ground.  
-Instead of performing a rollout, bellyhop (press B) directly after which leads into a waterslide.

To get through the entrance with a single slide requires some maneuvering between obstacles. The image above highlights two main points to avoid bonking off. The easiest way to do this is by first leaving a bit of space between Mario and the wall. After sliding past the forward-facing section of the wall, you can then hold the control stick forward and in toward the wall. Once Mario is sliding against the side you should be able to slide through freely without bonking. Notice that holding in towards the walls also help to avoid bonking on the further ahead wall and noki at the entrance.
