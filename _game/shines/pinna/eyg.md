# EYG
This is a strat where we access the Yoshi-Go-Round early, and skip Pinna Park episode 5.  
Pinna Park episode 4 is required to be completed to unlock Yoshi for this strategy.  
Due to the difficulty of this strategy, its usually recommended to just do Pinna Park episode 5 
and episode 6 as intended until you reach a low 1:2x time (Any% no ACE) as it only saves a little over a minute.

##  Advanced  
Top level players who play **JP** do 1-Stu but only have it do 1 pound, saving some time. The timing is tight on this strat and no tutorials exist as of this moment.
