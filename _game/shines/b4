# Bianco 4
Bianco 4 is a red coin shine which requires collecting 8 red coins for the shine to spawn. You should be comfortable with hoverslides, (jump) dive rollouts, (buffered) spin jumps, sideflips, and triple jumps to have success with this shine. The intermediate and advanced strats for this level require knowledge of glitchy wall kick hovers (GWKHs) and insta-momentum spin jumps.
### Beginner
#### Triple Jump Y-Turn
-From the start, hold up and hoverslide
-Aim towards the end of the log and buffer a hover as Mario slides off the path
-Hover briefly, then perform a small double jump off the log
-Triple jump y-turn off the grass by tapping A+Y together. You may roll your thumb from A to Y to ensure this is done properly
-Hold right during the y-turn then hover to the right of the bump in the wall
-Perform 3 dive rollouts along the wall, collecting the 1st red coin
-Hoverslide to continue along the wall then rollout through the 2nd red coin
-Perform a buffered spin jump to the left out of the rollout, then hover onto the second wall
-Hoverslide through the 3rd red coin then rollout to the roof with the 4th red coin
-Jump to the right onto the rope to collect the 5th red coin. Be sure not to jump too far or youâ€™ll miss the coin
-Jump off the rope and hover up to the roof with the 6th red coin. Hoverslide through it, aiming towards the 7th red coin and fall off the roof
-Let Mario fall briefly, then hover to the 7th red coin and turn left
-Dive to the roof below the wooden sails, then insta-momentum spin to the right. If you struggle with the insta-momentum spin, you can hover to the roof without diving and perform a normal spin jump to the right
-Hover onto the middle section of the final building and spin jump into the right pillar
-Wall kick to the left and collect the 8th red coin
-Jump and hover towards the rope, then dive rollout onto it. If you want to avoid missing the rope, you can skip the dive rollout and hover all the way to the rope instead.
-Perform three jump dives off the rope, ground pounding before the 2nd and 3rd ground pound, until diving into the shine

If you struggle with the insta-momentum spin after the 7th coin, you can hover to the roof without diving and perform a normal spin jump to the right.
