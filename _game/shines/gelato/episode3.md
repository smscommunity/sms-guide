# Gelato 3

Wiggler Ahoy! Full Steam Ahead!

**Tips**  
- Spray the first dunebud right away, activating it before Wiggler runs into it.
- Wait until he **stops completely** before groundpounding him for the first hit (Earliest known acceptable frame is 16.28 SGT).
- Make sure to spray the second dunebud and activate it before Wiggler runs into it.
- There is an [audio cue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE-fUCuGjtk) for when to spray the third dunebud.
