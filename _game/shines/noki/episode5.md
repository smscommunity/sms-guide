# Noki 5

Noki 5 is a race with Piantissimo.

## Getting to Piantissimo  
**RTA Strats**
#### Hoverslide  
{% include yt.html id="NL7vDlxqFC4" %}  
#### Spinjump  
{% include yt.html id="ABAwt06qHCA" %}  
You can see a combination of [Sign Strats](https://smscommunity.github.io/sms-guide/techniques/signstrats/) and a jumpdive bonk off of the pole. Using the setup found on the [Sign Strats](https://smscommunity.github.io/sms-guide/techniques/signstrats/) page, you can grab the shine and have fast text optimally this way.
