# Noki 5 is a race with Piantissimo.

### [Sign Strats](https://smscommunity.github.io/sms-guide/techniques/signstrats/)  

**Ignoring the IL Entry movement to Piantissimo,** you can see a combination of Sign Strats and a jumpdive bonk off of the pole. Using the setup found on the Sign Strats page, you can grab the shine and have fast text optimally this way.
