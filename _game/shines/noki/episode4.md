When the level starts, Mario will begin to **sink towards the Eel**
  * Don't Hover before reaching the Eel - *doing so will just needlessly delay the fight from starting*
  * While falling down, make sure to grab one of the Air Bubbles to refill F.L.U.D.D's tank;  
    I'd recommend grabbing the [first one on the left side](https://i.imgur.com/gcgne2D.jpg) for 6 tooth  
    I'd recommend grabbing the [first one on the right side](https://i.imgur.com/CvAos2W.jpg) for 5 tooth  
        Position Mario above the Bubble, slightly towards the bottom, once you hit it, hold Forward on the Control Stick    
        *remember to not hover - just swim Mario into the bubble*
  * After you refill your tank, position Mario above the center of the Eel's mouth - *favoring [slightly towards the top side](https://i.imgur.com/wy6Wg6Z.jpg)*
 
Once the **Eel starts to spin**: *Take note of its spinning direction, and Y-Turn accordingly*

Once the **Eel begins to scream**: Hold Hover until its mouth is nearly open  
*holding slightly backwards will help to clean multiple teeth with your hover*
 
Enter Y-Cam and **clean off the center 4 teeth** - starting with the left tooth, and working around clockwise  
*make sure to hover while turning around to face the 3rd/4th teeth*
 
Hover as needed to remain high enough to not be eaten by the Eel and **clean the 5th tooth**
 
**Gold Tooth**

The Gold Tooth is located on the right side of the Female half of the Eel - *the side with eyelashes instead of eyebrows*   
*this tooth has similar properties to a center tooth, allowing you to clean it off without the eel beginning to spin*
 
  * **5 Tooth**: *to make this more simple - reverse the direction that you Y-Turn at the beginning of the fight*  
    If you plan on going for a *5 Tooth Eel*, you should prioritize cleaning the side of the Eel without the Gold Tooth first, since using the Gold Tooth for Cutscene Skip is generally considered easier

  * **6 Tooth**: 
    If you plan on going for a *6 Tooth Eel*, you're going to want to clean the Gold Tooth as one of the first 5 teeth, because of its unique properties that allow you to clean it without forcing the Eel to spin
 
**Cancelling a Spin Cycle** - *once the Eel begins to spin*:
  * Let Mario fall down in the Eel's mouth until it cries out and tries to eat you (**Don't get eaten!**)
  * Hover out of the Eel's mouth before you get eaten and then Y-Turn around to set up for the next tooth  
      *I find it easier if you Y-Turn in the opposite direction of the tooth you're trying to clean*: [example](https://clips.twitch.tv/SullenSeductivePineappleDoubleRainbow)
 
**7th Tooth**  
When cleaning off the 7th tooth, try to leave a bottom side tooth as the last remaining tooth, this makes getting Cutscene Skip easier  
 
**Cutscene Skip**  
After you clean the 7th tooth, instead of hovering outside of the Eel's mouth, try to position Mario between the Eel's lips
  * Begin to Hover when the Eel fully closes its mouth *(listen for the eel "smacking" its lips together)*
  * Switch to the Spray Nozzle and enter Y-Cam once Mario is inside of the tooth - spray the tooth until it's cleaned  
  
If you did this correctly then Mario should've taken damage from the tooth while cleaning it off, causing the cutscene trigger to be skipped - *this doesn't actually 'skip' the cutscene, but merely allows you to control Mario while the cutscene plays*

**If you miss the Cutscene Skip**:  
Mario sinks slower while above the center of the Eel's Chamber, so try to go towards the outer walls as fast as possible  
*try not to hover, as this will just cause you to have to sink extra distance*
 
**Shine Get**: *[alternative angle](https://i.imgur.com/VXLqIyj.jpg)*

Spawns to the right of the small stalagmite - *shown in the picture above*  
The shine spawn is on the left side of what looks to be a Square with a large dot inside of it, *[as seen here](https://i.imgur.com/zzA3CcQ.jpg)*  
   
**Reasons for the Eel going down**
  * if you get eaten
  * if the Eel fully completes a Spin Cycle
  * if you complete 6 tooth too fast (sometimes)  
  
  
**!!! IF AT ANY POINT THE EEL GOES DOWN !!!**  

**DO NOT** clean off any more teeth until the Eel spins **AND** you cancel its Spin Cycle - *if you clean off a tooth before cancelling a Spin Cycle, then the Eel **WILL** 100% go back down again*
 
**The only scenarios in which you wouldn't need to wait for the Eel to spin are**  
* if there is only 1 tooth left - *the fight would end after*  
* if there are 2 teeth left on the same side, and 1 of them is the gold tooth  
    *in this case you can clean the gold tooth off first, and then the final remaining tooth*  
    *this would put the final tooth on the top side of the Eel's mouth, causing Cutscene Skip to be difficult to perform*
 
**Tooth Immunity**: *when are the eel's teeth immune?*  
  * if you finish cleaning 1 of the Eel's outside teeth *(other than the Gold Tooth)*
  * if the Eel is doing a Spin Cycle
  * if the Eel is going down after finishing a Spin Cycle

*Note: if you forced the Eel's mouth to close by being too far down in its mouth, you can still clean its teeth*
