# Noki 3  

Tips:
<i>
- Try your best to preserve forward momentum
- Go neutral as you land for coin 7 to insantly be able to go backwards
- Hover as little as possible, but if you need to, try to do it in a way that preserves your momentum

#### Right Side  
Easier and faster ending, goes right side from 7th to 8th coin.
