# Noki 7  
Like the other episode seven shines, Noki 7 features a Shadow Mario (SM) chase sequence. The most useful technique to know for this shine is spam spraying. The Insta-kill saves just over 3 seconds, so even though this SM is at the very end of the run, many top players will go for the instakill.
