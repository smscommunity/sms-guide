# Noki 2 
Noki 2, like noki 1, is a very movement intensive shine, however it is a fair bit easier by being much less hazardous. It also includes a skip called Spring Clip that completely skips a Gooper Blooper refight. It is STRONGLY recommended that runners of all skill levels learn this strat as it is extremely easy and saves 50+ seconds over fighting Gooper Blooper again.  

## Beginner  
- Start by jumping upright and hovering towards the tall platform then dive rollout off of it.
- Do a full sized jump into another dive rollout to land towards left pair of walls.
- Sideflip to the right and wallkick off the right wall. 4 decently sized wallkicks should get you to the next section.
- Jump and double jump to the small raised platform, then sideflip to the higher platform to the left of it. 
- Move the camera behind mario then do a triple jump sequence into a wallkick off the platform ahead of you.
- Once you landed from the wallkick, turn the camera towards the slope and sideflip diverollout onto it.
- Hover double jump when you get close to the wall then do 2 wallkicks off the two walls there.
- Do a dive rollout and buffer a spinjump upright while rolling out.
- Wallkick off the wall to the right and hover towards the spring.
- Spray the spring so it shrinks then press B to grab it.
- Once you've grabbed the spring, jump down to the area below to the left of you, the turn your camera in such a way where when you hold upright towards the corner, mario runs against it. 
- When mario is running against the corner, press B to throw the spring, and then the spring will enlarge and push mario through the wall. When mario clips through, start hovering slightly left and forward.
- Once you've hovered for about 2 seconds, let go of hover and dive forward. You should land in the shine room. Rollout from your dive, then sideflip hoverdive into the shine.

### Intermediate
- Do a hoverslide upright towards the tall platform, then dive rollout off of it.
- Do a short hop into a dive rollout and buffer an upleft spinjump while rolling out.
- Buffer Spinjump upleft towards the left wall, then go neutral to kill some horizontal speed to reduce bonking chance (this is only necessary for this first wallkick), wallkick off the left wall, then hold upright towards the right wall then wallkick off of that, aim upleft towards the back wall then wallkick off of that, then finally, wallkick off of the left wall and land on the platform above.
- As you're landing on the platform above, turn the camera and buffer an upright spinjump to the wall of the platform above and right of you, then wallkick off of it. (this wallkick is very tricky as you want mario to walk about 2-3 steps so he has a running start. This running start gives mario more speed, which gives more height that you MUST have for this wallkick to work, this'll take practice but gets easier with time.)
- After you wallkick, chain that into a double jump as you land, then triple jump off of the next platform and wallkick off the wall of the higher platform.
- As you're landing from the wallkick to the higher right platform, turn the camera so that the slope is upleft of you, then sideflip dive rollout upleft onto the slope.
- Hover double jump then wallkick off the two walls.
- Dive rollout and spray during the rollout to spray the spring from below, and buffer an upright spinjump while rolling out.
- Buffer spinjump upright then wallkick off the wall, then hover towards the spring.
- Dive onto the platform where the spring is, then dive again while holding B so you grab the spring instead of bonking off of it.
- Do the same alignment with the spring as explained in the beginner explanation.
- As soon as you throw the spring, turn the camera slightly left, and the moment mario clips through the wall, press B to dive and hold forward.
- As mario gets close to the shine room, Go into Y cam and turn mario towards the shine platform, then immediately leave Y cam (DO NOT GO INTO Y CAM TOO EARLY! Y cam kills a lot of horizontal speed, and if you're too early with Y cam, you won't have enough horizontal speed to reach the spring room and you'll fall OoB, making you have to exit area and start the level over again.)
- Upon landing in the shine room, short rollout into a buffered spinjump hoverdive into the shine.

### Advanced
- Do a hoverslide upright towards the tall platform, then dive rollout off of it.
- As you pass by the dark line on the small slope after the water platform, roll your thumb from B to A to do an instant dive rollout, then buffer an upleft spinjump.
- The Diagonal wallkicks, the wallkick afterward, the triple jump sequence into another wallkick, and the dive rollout onto the slope are more or less the same as they were in the intermediate explanation.
- After you dive rollout onto the slope, do another thumbroll from B to A for another instant dive rollout while running up the slope.
- As you reach the wall, single jump while holding neutral or right so you kill your horizontal speed (killing your speed is important here because if you have too much horizontal speed, you'll bonk off the wall instead of sliding down it.)
- Walljump twice and make your wallkicks big otherwise you won't reach the top of the left wall.
- Dive rollout and spray during the rollout to spray the spring from below, and buffer an upright spinjump while rolling out.
- Buffer spinjump upright and wallkick dive off the right wall, completely negating the hover towards the spring.
- Short rollout while holding B as you run into the spring, making mario grab it as his rollout ends.
- The spring alignment, throw, dive into the shine room, and Y cam movement afterward are the same as in the intermediate explanation.
- Upon landing in the shine room, short rollout into a buffered spinjump hoverdive into the shine.
