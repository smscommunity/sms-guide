Translations of deleted tweets:  
"The dirt information is stored in image format.
In the case of SB6, the dirt information within the range of x = -8192 to 8192 and z = -8192 to 8192 is stored as a 512x512 image.
However, each pixel does not represent the color of the dirt, but rather a value like opacity from 0 to 255."  

""Texture" (64x64)
The size in world coordinates is 400x400.
The alpha value at the center is 10 (out of 255)."
