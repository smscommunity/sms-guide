# **Sirena 2**  

Sirena 2 is widely considered to be one of the hardest secrets in the game. You're going to want to practice this level a good amount to get the hang of it.

Just like the other secret stages, there's 2 parts. The entry and the secret itself. this page will include videos and text descriptions for both seperatly.

## Entry

### Beginner
#### Using the boo platforms
- Start by doing a double jumpdive rollout sequence towards upright.
- Hoverslide towards the stairs.
- As you reach the hotel manager, rollout while spraying and only slightly holding forward, then as you're landing go neutral on the stick, then press B to talk to the manager (If done right, you will effectively spray the manager, making his talk window larger, but mario will also go to a complete stop, allowing him to talk to the manager as mario cannot talk to npcs if he's moving faster than a tiptoe).
- Once inside the hotel turn slightly right and spam spray the pink boos. 
- When the pink boos have all turned into the platforms, double jump onto the closest, rightmost boo platform, then jump onto the boo platform directly in front of you, then jump to the second floor.
- Hold down to turn around 180 degrees then go into Y cam, then look upward and spam spray the higher boos. 
- Spinjump onto the platform closest to the secret entrance, then hold Digital R, then press A to backflip, then press B at the apex of the backflip to dive into the secret entrance (in some cases the boo position rng can end up being way to the sides of the secret entry, not giving a clear shot. If that happens, just sideflip then hover into the entrance).

### Intermediate
#### Hoverslide into wallkicks
- Dive into short rollout towards upright, then jump while spraying water, when your height is higher than the ground above, dive and you'll waterslide.
- The waterslide to the manager is the same as the beginner explanation.
- Start a hoverslide then veer left, rollout onto the far left side of the plants, buffer spinjump off the far side of the plants while spraying, spinjump wallkick off the second floor railing, spinjump wallkick off the pole, then finally spinjump wallkick off the third floor railing to land in the secret entrance.

#### Boo Bounce into wallkicks
- Start with a hoverdive rollout towards upright, then jump while spraying, when mario's height is higher than the ground above, dive and you'll waterslide.
- The waterslide to the manager is the same as the previous explanations.
- As soon as you gain control of mario in the hotel, dive. Once diving, veer left.
- Do a medium sized rollout into a buffered spinjump dive towards the back leftmost boo.
- As you're about to bounce off the boo, charge a spin. This will make mario spin bounce off the boo, killing any chance of ledgegrabbing the second floor railing as mario cannot ledgegrab while spinning.
- Spinjump wallkick off the second floor railing, spinjump wallkick off the pole, then finally wallkick dive off the third floor railing into the secret entrance.
