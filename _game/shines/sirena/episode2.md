# **Sirena 2**  

Sirena 2 is widely considered to be one of the hardest secrets in the game. You're going to want to practice this level a good amount to get the hang of it.

Just like the other secret stages, there's 2 parts. The entry and the secret itself. this page will include videos and text descriptions for both seperatly.

## Entry

### Beginner
#### Using the boo platforms
- Start by doing a double jumpdive rollout sequence towards upright.
- Hoverslide towards the stairs.
- As you reach the hotel manager, rollout while spraying and only slightly holding forward, then as you're landing go neutral on the stick, then press B to talk to the manager (If done right, you will effectively spray the manager, making his talk window larger, but mario will also go to a complete stop, allowing him to talk to the manager as mario cannot talk to npcs if he's moving faster than a tiptoe).
- Once inside the hotel turn slightly right and spam spray the pink boos. 
- When the pink boos have all turned into the platforms, double jump onto the closest, rightmost boo platform, then jump onto the boo platform directly in front of you, then jump to the second floor.
- Hold down to turn around 180 degrees then go into Y cam, then look upward and spam spray the higher boos. 
- Spinjump onto the platform closest to the secret entrance, then hold Digital R, then press A to backflip, then press B at the apex of the backflip to dive into the secret entrance (in some cases the boo position rng can end up being way to the sides of the secret entry, not giving a clear shot. If that happens, just sideflip then hover into the entrance).

### Intermediate
#### Hoverslide into wallkicks
- Dive into short rollout towards upright, then jump while spraying water, when your height is higher than the ground above, dive and you'll waterslide.
- The waterslide to the manager is the same as the beginner explanation.
- Start a hoverslide then veer left, rollout onto the far left side of the plants, buffer spinjump off the far side of the plants while spraying, spinjump wallkick off the second floor railing, spinjump wallkick off the pole, then finally spinjump wallkick off the third floor railing to land in the secret entrance.

#### Boo Bounce into wallkicks
- Start with a hoverdive rollout towards upright, then jump while spraying, when mario's height is higher than the ground above, dive and you'll waterslide.
- The waterslide to the manager is the same as the previous explanations.
- As soon as you gain control of mario in the hotel, dive. Once diving, veer left.
- Do a medium sized rollout into a buffered spinjump dive towards the back leftmost boo.
- As you're about to bounce off the boo, charge a spin. This will make mario spin bounce off the boo, killing any chance of ledgegrabbing the second floor railing as mario cannot ledgegrab while spinning.
- Spinjump wallkick off the second floor railing, spinjump wallkick off the pole, then finally wallkick dive off the third floor railing into the secret entrance.

## Secret  
### Beginner
- Start by doing a dive rollout as mario is spawning into the secret.
- Do a dive into a short rollout upleft, and hold downright as you're rolling out to wind up a sideflip.
- Sideflip onto the higher brick, and turn the camera to behind mario as you're sideflipping onto the brick.
- Jump onto the watermelon, then jumpdive rollout off the next high brick.
- Land and then dive off of the Soarin' Stu.
- Rollout roughly halfway through the sandblock, land onto the next Soarin' Stu.
- Triple jump off the next brick, skipping the last Soarin' Stu.
- As you're landing from the triple jump, dive rollout to break the first brick on the brick wall. 
- Sideflip left to break the second brick on the brick wall.
= Sideflip right, then wallkick off the right wall to break the third brick on the brick wall.
- Sideflip right, wallkick off the right wall, then spinjump wallkick off the left wall to break the last brick, with the spin slowing your fall enough so you don't have to go back to the bottom platform again, wallkick to the top of the brick wall.
- Jumpdive rollout off the first two sandblocks.
- Medium jump off of the second sandblock patch into a short dive rollout landing on the third sand block patch.
- Walk along the third sandblock patch, then dive rollout onto the next sandblock patch.
- Jump to the two sand blocks to the right. Tap upright to adjust for the curve upward these two sandblocks make.
- Jump to the last patch of sand blocks, then jumpdive rollout onto the melons.
- Dive short rollout on the melons, then walk forward until you walk off the last melon. As soon as mario falls off the last melon, ground pound, then you will land onto the spinning cog.
- Turn the camera left or right. As the current cog side begins to get steep, sideflip then ground pound to the next side.
- As the next cog side gets steep, sideflip ground pound again.
- After the second ground pound, center the camera, then spinjump dive (or sideflip dive) to the sandblock pyramid. As soon as mario's shadow is on the first block, ground pound to avoid bonking.
- Climb up the sandblocks, jumpdive across the hole, rollout off the highest sandblock on the other side, then finally jumpdive into the shine.

### Intermediate
- Start by doing a dive rollout as mario is spawning into the secret.
- Do a short hop into a buffered spinjump upleft, then triple jump delay dive off the higher brick (you risk bonking into the melon if you dive too early).
- Rollout off the brick just before the first soarin' stu and then dive after bouncing off of it.
- Rollout roughly halfway through the sandblock, land onto the next Soarin' Stu.
- Jump dive off the next brick, skipping the last soaring stu. 
- As you're landing from the jumpdive, rollout to break the first brick of the brick wall.
- Sideflip left to break the second brick on the brick wall, and tap right on the c stick to turn the camera slightly left. This will make mario's angle slightly diagonal, which makes the brick section a bit more optimal and sets you up better for the section afterward.
- Sideflip right, then spinjump wallkick off the right wall to break the third brick on the brick wall (you can turn the camera back towards the grey wall again since mario's angle shouldn't change from here), wallkick off the left wall, spinjump wallkick off the right wall to break the last brick of the brick wall, wallkick off the left wall again, then finally wallkick off the right wall to land on the upper grey platform.
- Jumpdive rollout off the first two sandblocks, then turn the camera towards the left side of the third sandblock patch while buffering a spinjump. 
- Spinjump dive towards the left side of the third sandblock patch. Upon landing, dive then rollout to the next patch of sandblocks while buffering another spinjump.
- Spinjump dive to the two sandblocks just past the patch you're on, then rollout off those two sandblocks.
- Jumpdive towards the left (or right) side of the melons, then rollout off of them straight to the cog down below.
- While staying on the left or right side, turn the camera left or right. As the current cog side begins to get steep, sideflip then ground pound to the next side, centering the camera as you land from said ground pound.
- As the current cog side you're now on begins to slope, jump, then dive into an instant momentum spin to the sandblock pyramid.
- Spinjump dive then rollout off of the highest sandblock on the far side of the pyramid, then finally jumpdive to the shine.
