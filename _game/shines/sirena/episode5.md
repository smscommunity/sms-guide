## The Fight  
#### Optimal Fight  
{% include yt.html id="Db7NxthMMOY" %}  

The second the fight starts and you gain control of Mario, you notice FoundYourGun do a backflip into the center of the arena. This is a trick called laugh skip and saves around 2 seconds. This also makes the hitboxes for the purple buttons much larger (for some reason).

Nothing much to note of the fight besides throwing peppers into his mouth, then throwing a normal fruit at him right after.

Important tips:
- You can cancel non-fruit cycles.
- You have to wait until the enemies/bubbles/coins are spawned in a mandatory not fruit cycle before cancelling it.
- If it is an "extra" cycle, where it is an extra Not Fruit cycle, **AND NOT A MANDATORY ONE**, you can cancel it the second you see the slot land on a non-fruit.
- You can hover into a durian if its placement is convenient for a quick fruit launch after throwing a pepper.
