# Sirena 5  
Sirena 5 is another notorious level, since you only have a 34.3% chance of getting perfect RNG.  

#### Video Explanation
{% include yt.html id="0_WZhr2ByyQ" %}  

Perfect cycles are: Fruitüçç, Not Fruit‚ùå, Fruitüçç, Not Fruit‚ùå, Fruitüçç. (if not going for [Cycle Skips](sms-guide/shines/sirena/episode5/#cycle-skips))  

Chance of getting a fruit cycle is 70% until going to 3 health or below.  
- Row = *What was last spawned*  
- Column = *What will be spawned next*

## Entering the Fight  
Optimal Entry  
{% include yt.html id="xURSkskvXWk" %}  

There is a small area you are able to get a ground pound that instantly triggers the elevator as shown in the video.

## The Fight  
#### Optimal Fight  
{% include yt.html id="Db7NxthMMOY" %}  

The second the fight starts and you gain control of Mario, you notice FoundYourGun do a backflip dive into the center of the arena. This is a trick called laugh skip and saves around 2 seconds. This also makes the hitboxes for the purple buttons much larger (for some reason).  

- Once you take control of Mario, backflip dive into the center of the arena to activate laugh skip.
- You can optionally ground pound the purple squares to stop the rotation of the roulette wheels to make grabbing the fruit easier.
- Spray King Boo the second he comes out of the ground.
  1. If you get a Fruitüçç cycle for the first roll, this it optimal.
  2. If you get a Not Fruit‚ùå for the first roll, *or when you should optimally get a Fruitüçç cycle*, this is an extra **NON-MANDATORY** cycle and you can cancel it the moment you notice the slot not stopping on fruit.
  3. If you get a Fruitüçç cycle, then a Not Fruit‚ùå cycle after, this is an extra **MANDATORY** cycle, and you have to wait until the enemies completely spawn before cancelling the cycle.
- As stated before, optimally the cycles are: Fruitüçç, Not Fruit‚ùå, Fruitüçç, Not Fruit‚ùå, Fruitüçç. (if not going for [Cycle Skips](sms-guide/shines/sirena/episode5/#cycle-skips))
- Once you get a Fruitüçç cycle, grab a pepper and throw it into King Boo's tongue.
- After he reacts to the pepper, throw a normal fruit into King Boo.
- Repeat this 3 times.

Important tips:  
- Aim to throw the pepper at his tongue  
- Each fruit has a different throw arc. Learn them.  
- You can hover into a durian if its placement is convenient for a quick fruit launch after throwing a pepper.

## Cycle Skips
An RNG strat that loses about 2 seconds each time you go for it, but has the potential to save around 10 seconds each time you get it. Getting a cycle skip is a 1/64 chance, is pure luck, and you need to do it twice to save up to 20 seconds (getting it twice is 1/4096 or a 0.017% chance). Samu was lucky enough to get it around [7th try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIcjtHJf4AI), and AverageTrey grinded for it for [18 months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFDljTWMRvE) before he got it. 

To go for it, you simply need to run under King Boo right when he starts to spin his splits after being sprayed on a Not Fruit‚ùå cycle. When you run under King Boo while his slots are spinning, you will get whatever they show once King Boo reappears. On its own this wouldn't be useful, but whenever King Boo reappears, his slots are set to random positions **regardless of the normal cycle rules**. So if this is done while the slots are spinning, you will get a cycle based on those random positions, with some possible leftover rotation if the slots don't have time to stop before King Boo reappears.
