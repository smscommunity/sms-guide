### Slot Chances Based on Health

#### The Fight  
{% include yt.html id="Db7NxthMMOY" %}  

The second the fight starts and you gain control of Mario, you notice FoundYourGun do a backflip dive into the center of the arena. This is a trick called **laugh skip** and saves ~2 seconds. This also makes the hitboxes for the purple buttons much larger (for some reason).  

- Once you take control of Mario, backflip dive into the center of the arena to activate laugh skip.
- You can optionally ground pound the purple squares to stop the rotation of the roulette wheels to make grabbing the fruit easier.
- Spray King Boo the second he comes out of the ground.
  1. If you get a Fruitüçç cycle for the first roll, this is optimal.
  2. If you get a Not Fruit‚ùå for the first roll, *or when you should optimally get a Fruitüçç cycle*, this is an extra **NON-MANDATORY** cycle and you can cancel it the moment you notice the slot not stopping on fruit.
  3. If you get a Fruitüçç cycle, then a Not Fruit‚ùå cycle after, this is an extra **MANDATORY** cycle, and you have to wait until the enemies spawn before cancelling the cycle.
- As stated before, optimally the cycles are: Fruitüçç, Not Fruit‚ùå, Fruitüçç, Not Fruit‚ùå, Fruitüçç. (if not going for [Cycle Skips](#cycle-skips))
- Once you get a Fruitüçç cycle, grab a pepper and throw it into King Boo's tongue.
- After he reacts to the pepper, throw a normal fruit at King Boo.
- Repeat this 3 times.

*Important tips:*  
- Aim to throw the pepper at his tongue.  
- Each fruit has a different throw arc. Learn them.  
- You can hover into a durian if its placement is convenient for a quick fruit launch after throwing a pepper.

#### Cycle Skips

{: .text-gamma}
An RNG strat that loses about 2 seconds each time you go for it, but has the potential to save around 12 seconds each time you get it. Getting a cycle skip is a 1/64 chance, is pure luck, and you need to do it twice to save up to **a total of 20 seconds** (getting it twice is 1/4096 or a 0.017% chance). This doesn't include the odds that a perfect King Boo needs a Fruitüçç cycle first, which reduces the odds even further to 0.7/4096, or around **1/5851**! Samura1Man was lucky enough to get it around [7th try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIcjtHJf4AI), and AverageTrey grinded for it for [18 months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFDljTWMRvE) before he got it. 

To go for it, you simply need to run under King Boo right when he starts to spin his slots after being sprayed on a Not Fruit‚ùå cycle. When you run under King Boo while his slots are spinning, you will get a roll once King Boo reappears. On its own this wouldn't be useful, but whenever King Boo reappears, his slots are set to random positions **regardless of the normal cycle rules**. So if this is done while the slots are spinning, you will get a cycle based on those random positions, with some possible leftover rotation if the slots don't have time to stop before King Boo reappears.
