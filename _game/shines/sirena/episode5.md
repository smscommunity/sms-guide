Getting a fruit cycle is 70% until going to 3 health or below.

Perfect cycles are: Fruitüçç, Not Fruit‚ùå, Fruitüçç, Not Fruit‚ùå, Fruitüçç.

## The Fight  
#### Optimal Fight  
{% include yt.html id="Db7NxthMMOY" %}  

The second the fight starts and you gain control of Mario, you notice FoundYourGun do a backflip into the center of the arena. This is a trick called laugh skip and saves around 2 seconds. This also makes the hitboxes for the purple buttons much larger (for some reason).

Nothing much to note of the fight besides throwing peppers into his mouth, then throwing a normal fruit at him right after.

Important tips:
- You can cancel non-fruit cycles.
- You have to wait until the enemies/bubbles/coins are spawned in a mandatory not fruit cycle before cancelling it.
- If it is an "extra" cycle, where it is an extra Not Fruit cycle, **AND NOT A MANDATORY ONE**, you can cancel it the second you see the slot land on a non-fruit.
- You can hover into a durian if its placement is convenient for a quick fruit launch after throwing a pepper.

## Cycle Skips
An RNG strat that loses about 2 seconds each time you go for it, but has the potential to save around 10 seconds each time you get it. Getting a cycle skip is a 1/64 chance, is pure luck, and you need to do it twice to save up to 20 seconds (getting it twice is 1/4096 or a 0.017% chance). Samu was lucky enough to get it around [7th try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIcjtHJf4AI), and AverageTrey grinded for it for [18 months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFDljTWMRvE) before he got it. 

To go for it, you simply need to run under King Boo right when he starts to spin his splits after being sprayed on a Not Fruit‚ùå cycle. When you run under King Boo while his slots are spinning, you will get whatever they show once King Boo reappears. On its own this wouldn't be useful, but whenever King Boo reappears, his slots are set to random positions **regardless of the normal cycle rules**. So if this is done while the slots are spinning, you will get a cycle based on those random positions, with some possible leftover rotation if the slots don't have time to stop before King Boo reappears.
