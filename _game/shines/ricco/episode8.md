# Ricco 8 

### 120 Shines
This might be the most infamous level in 120 Shines. Right at the end of the run in optimal routes and has the chance to just keep giving you other fruits instead of a durian. You must get Yoshi to eat the butterflies. He always will want a durian, and the only way to get a durian is from the fruit machine. Perform Ricco 5 movement until you get to the fruit machine. Ground pound the alternative parts of the machine until you get a durian. You can walk into the durian, spray the durian, or the fastest, kick the durian to get it to Yoshi.

#### Fruit Machine
- Initially, all fruit has a 20% chance of spawning.
- The game will re-roll the RNG up to three times if it rolls a fruit that is already spawned, after which it will create a "ghost" fruit.
- Probability of 3 or fewer tries is 58.6% and anything more should be considered back luck.
- [This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xIVyWnNunZre9GAAMbc2z4NvweOlJpv9A0VZutQRm2s/edit?gid=0#gid=0) of the odds is not entirely accurate as fruit will start to despawn after about 7 tries or so, which reduces the probability of getting a durian., but is the closest thing we have to statistics for this fruit machine.
- Fruits from the fruit machine despawn 40 seconds after they come out (as opposed to 2 minutes after being moved like every other fruit in the game)

#### Butterflies
Eat the butterflies near yoshi.

#### Fish Bucket
The next coin is in the bucket of blue fish near where Yoshi was. Spray the left bucket (no need to spam spray) and the coin should appear.

#### Wall M
The next coin is on a far wall. We need to keep Yoshi to get the shine at the end of the level. You can move along the cliffs on the side of the stage, or you can spray the fish with Yoshi to create moving platforms which is slower.

#### Platform M
After getting the far M on the cliff wall, move across the platforms with Yoshi to get the M on the floor of a platform. After spawning the coin, Y-turn up to spray the Jelly above the shine. Collect, the coin, spin jump towards the shine with Yoshi, and collect the shine.

Notes:
- You can clip directly into the shine cage with Yoshi by fluttering backwards into a corner.
- If you ever end up in a sewer, DO NOT GET SEWER GLITCH. If you touch a durian with sewer glitch it will launch and might go in the water.
- Yoshi can spin jump very high, you can cover large gaps with this.
- Doing a jump-spin-flutter with Yoshi can cover a surprising amount of horizontal distance. It's very useful for moving along the cliffs and platforms in this section.

### 79/96+
Grab the turbo in the cage in the boat in front of you. Use it to go quickly grab the rocket under the helipad (where you fight Blooper in Ricco 5). Then grab a coconut up off the tree on the cliffside and put it in a spot where you can pick it back up. Rocket storage twice then grab the coconut, then sidestep off the ledge activating your rocket storage. Use Y-Cam if needed to adjust your angle. You will need to land on the platform with the caged Shine Sprite. Place the coconut while standing on the 5th row of dots on the platform's texture, and jump and grab the cage. Climb down into the coconut and it should clip you through.

### All Episodes
The same strat to grab the Shine as the 79/96 route, but a different approach to the coconut. The rocket nozzle is not there when you do Ricco in the All Episodes route, so you will need to go and grab the rocket nozzle high on the catwalk that is meant for Ricco 3 casual route.
