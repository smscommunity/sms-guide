# Pianta 4 
Pianta 4 entails getting the Chomp to the bath on the other side of the map.  

## Getting to the Chomp  
#### Standard Start

#### Mushroom Slide  
*Intermediate*

## The Chomp's Chain  
An important tip to keep in mind is the hitbox for the screw you grab at the end of the chomp's chain is slightly behind the screw itself.  
While holding the chain, press L to center your camera and hold forward while the Chomp is going down the path. When there is a fork in the road, the Chomp will always go down the path going away from Mario's current location.  

The inputs to let go of the Chomp's chain quickly is:  
`Holding B -> Start holding A+B together -> Let go of both A+B -> Tap B`
