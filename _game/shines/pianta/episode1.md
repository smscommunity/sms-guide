# Pianta 1 

Pianta 1 is a shine where you need to pull the tails of 3 Chomps, shooting them into a body of water to cool them off.  

*This level has a [version difference](https://smscommunity.notion.site/Version-Differences-a2da9d8b0b33445a9f361d633f38e969)*  

- You cannot put the chomplets out with your hover nozzle immediately on NTSC-U/PAL.

A strat lost to time and rediscovered to be faster, you go left first and trigger Chomp B first instead of Chomp A, if you see Chomp A go down the purple/red "Forgotten" path.  
*All of these are Advanced*
