# Pianta 1 


Pianta 1 is a shine where you need to put out and pull the tails of 3 Chomps, and put them into a body of water.  

*This level has a [version difference](https://smscommunity.notion.site/Version-Differences-a2da9d8b0b33445a9f361d633f38e969)*  

- You cannot put the chomplets out with your hover nozzle immediately on NTSC-U/PAL.
