# Pianta 5
Pianta 5 is made up of two parts: the Entry and the Secret.

## Entry

## Secret
Upon entry, dive rollout then perform two jump dive rollouts to talk to the first Chuckster.

### Early Cycle RNG
The final chuckster can stop at one of 6 nodes on the upper platform. These are shown below:

The chuckster starts at position 1 and walks counter-clockwise continuously through the six nodes. When the chuckster begins his walking phase, a timer is set to a random value between 2.5 and 25 seconds. When this timer finishes, the chuckster will continue walking until he reaches the next node and then stop. Once the chuckster stops, he will wait for a random amount of time between 0.833 and 10 seconds. Then he will begin his walking phase again, and the process repeats continuously.

**WARNING: HAND-WAVEY APPROXIMATIONS BELOW**

To attain early cycle, you must talk to the chuckster by the time he is in the position shown above, just short of halfway between nodes 3 and 4. The image above depicts a cycle where the chuckster did not stop at node 2 or 3, so the fastest the chuckster will reach this position is at roughly 15.5 seconds. The IL WR for this level reaches this position at approximately 19.5 seconds. This means that to attain early cycle with WR-level execution, the chuckster must delay his movement by roughly 4 seconds by stopping at nodes 2 and/or 3.

The chuckster reaches node 3 at roughly 12.2 seconds. Therefore there's about a 43.1% chance that the chuckster stops at node 2 or 3. Once stopped, there's roughly a 56.4% chance that the chuckster stops for at least 4 seconds. Therefore, with WR-level execution, the highest probability of attaining early-cycle is roughly 24.3%.
