#### Spin Spray #5  
*Intermediate*  
- Take time immediately to line your angle up to execute Over the Wall #6 while #5 finishes unlocking (good unlock RNG gives you less time to prepare)
- Most common way to do this is run forward with the hover nozzle and press [Digital R](https://smscommunity.github.io/sms-guide/techniques/spamsprays/#the-difference-between-analog-and-digital) as you run off the slope of the grass
- Right when you start hovering, press X (Keep holding Digital R)
- Do a spinjump as you land, do a spam spray spinjump

#### Over the Wall #6
*Intermediate*  
- After Spin Spray #5, do a delayed dive rollout with your preprepared angle
- Do another dive rollout (or a hoverslide rollout) while lining your angle up to do Mushroom Unlock #7

#### Mushroom Unlock #7
