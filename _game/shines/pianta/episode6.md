# Pianta 6
Clean 10 Piantas covered in lava as fast as possible then return to the mayor and collect the shine.  
A favorite [IL](https://smscommunity.github.io/sms-guide/info/il/) among many for having a high skill ceiling and many strat options.

#### Spin Spray #5  
*Intermediate*  
- Take time immediately to line your angle up to execute Over the Wall #6 while #5 finishes unlocking (good unlock RNG gives you less time to prepare)
- Most common way to do this is run forward with the hover nozzle and press [Digital R](https://smscommunity.github.io/sms-guide/techniques/spamsprays/#the-difference-between-analog-and-digital) as you run off the slope of the grass
- Right when you start hovering, press X (Keep holding Digital R)
- Do a spinjump as you land, do a spam spray spinjump

#### Over the Wall #6
*Intermediate*  
- After Spin Spray #5, do a delayed dive rollout with your preprepared angle
- Do another dive rollout (or a hoverslide rollout) while lining your angle up to do Mushroom Unlock #7

{% include gdrive.html id="1qrtBFHw9XtOLeCAk_TOUIWQFILHh4uPP" %}

#### Mushroom Unlock #7  
*Intermediate*  
- Aim just left of the tree
- When landing on the mushroom, rollout immediately (eating dust changes your angle)
