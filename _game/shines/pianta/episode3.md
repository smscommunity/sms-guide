- Perform jump dive rollouts following the pattern below until reaching the tree
- Stand at the base of the tree and allow a wind spirit to hit you
- Using the invincibility frames from the wind spirit, jump dive into the goop and rollout to the rail
- This will cause Mario to ledgegrab the rail. Walk forward and jump dive and rollout through the safe spots in the goop
- Spin jump, sideflip, and jump up the structure until reaching FLUDD
- Jump onto the platform with the gold mushroom, the sideflip out from under it
- Hover back to the edge of the gold mushroom, ledgegrab, then spam spray and talk to the mayor and collect the shine
