# Pianta 3
Pianta 3 requires well-timed damage boosting to make it through the fiery goop.
#### Right Side Damage Boost  
*Beginner*  
This is a very basic strat that loses roughly 6 seconds to the intermediate damage boost.
- Perform jump dive rollouts following the pattern below until reaching the tree
- Stand at the base of the tree and allow a wind spirit to hit you
- Using the invincibility frames from the wind spirit, jump dive into the goop and rollout to the rail
- This will cause Mario to ledgegrab the rail. Walk forward and jump dive and rollout through the safe spots in the goop
- Spin jump, sideflip, and jump up the structure until reaching FLUDD
- Jump onto the platform with the gold mushroom, the sideflip out from under it
- Hover back to the edge of the gold mushroom, ledgegrab, then spam spray and talk to the mayor and collect the shine

#### Normal Boost, No GWKD  
*Intermediate*  
This strat loses roughly 2 seconds to the advanced strat.
- (Jump) dive and rollout across the bridge following the pattern in the video below
- Triple jump dive then rollout between the Piantas and stopping at this spot at the edge of the fiery goop

- Allow the wind spirit to knock you forward into the goop, then jump dive, rollout, and jump dive onto the rail
- Rollout onto the box and sideflip (or spinjump) onto the mushroom
- Sideflip dive on the platform, hold back and peform a small rollout, and sideflip up to the next platform
- Jump up to FLUDD, jump to the next platform, and sideflip out from under the gold mushroom
- Hover back to the edge of the gold mushroom, ledgegrab, then spam spray and talk to the mayor and collect the shine

#### Normal Boost, GWKD  
*Advanced*  
- After the wind spirit knocks you forward into the goop, buffer a spinjump dive out of the getting up animation and rollout onto the rail
- Spin jump dive to the mushroom, then insta-momentum spin up left towards the ledge
- GWKD off the ledge by pressing Y+A+B, then hold right and ground pound onto FLUDD
- Jump to the next platform, and sideflip out from under the gold mushroom
- Hover back to the edge of the gold mushroom, ledgegrab, then spam spray and talk to the mayor and collect the shine
