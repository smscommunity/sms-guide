# Bianco 5
Bianco 5 is made up of two parts: the Entry and the Petey Fight. You should be comfortable with hoverslides, (jump) dive rollouts, spin jumps, sideflips, and triple jumps to have success with this shine.
## Entry

#### Log Triple Jump
*Beginner*  
- From the start, hold up and hoverslide
- Aim for the middle of the log, buffer a hover as you slide off the path, release hover, then double jump off the log
- Triple jump and hover up to the while wall
- Dive rollout left along the wall twice, then spin jump and hover up to the higher section of the wall
- Buffer a hover over the gap in the wall, then spin jump and hover up to the green slope
- Spam spray and dive rollout twice to clear goop and get to the flat section of the grass
- Spam spray and dive into the water to waterslide, then rollout and allow a poink to attach to FLUDD
- Backflip and shoot the poink to hit Petey

#### Rope-Y
*Intermediate*  
This is roughly 2 seconds faster than the Log Triple strat
- From the start, hold up and hoverslide
- Aim for the middle of the log, buffer a hover as you slide off the path
- Release hover, then spin jump with A+Y to Y-turn to the left onto the rope
- Jump off the rope, hover and turn left, then dive rollout off the windmill onto the roof
- Spin jump while spraying, then dive into the water on the white wall to waterslide
- Finish the entry the same as the beginnger strat

#### Grass-Slide Triple Jump
*Intermediate*  
This is roughly 0.5 seconds faster than the Rope-Y strat
- At the start of the level, turn the camera slightly to the right, then hold up and hoverslide
- Aim the hoverslide for the last part of the grass which is not raised above the path
- Slide off the grass and double jump off the path and over the river
- Triple jump off the grass while holding back to avoid bonking, then wall kick off the windmill
- Hover and turn right, then dive and short rollout on the roof
- Spin jump while spraying, then dive into the water on the white wall to waterslide
- Finish the entry the same as the beginnger strat

## Petey Fight
Petey travels randomly between various nodes according to the map shown below. Petey always enters this area from Node N1.
![Petey Map](https://i.imgur.com/w0pf6Vx.jpeg)
Petey will stop at blue nodes and continue flying through red nodes. When Petey first enters the graph at N1, he’s not coming from any of the represented nodes, so they’re all equally likely. The path indicated by a red double arrow is twice as likely as the others unless it’s the path Petey just came from, in which case the blue single arrow path is twice as likely as the others. Petey can take 774 unique patterns with the fastest being roughly 59 seconds faster than the slowest. An average pattern will lose roughly 14.3 seconds to the fastest.

When Petey reaches a blue node, he will stop and fly in mid-air. At this point, he can be sprayed down so you can fill him with water then ground pound his belly. This must be done 3 times to defeat Petey. In addition to RNG from Petey's movement, Petey has a 60% chance of throwing a tornado each time he lands. Each tornado causes roughly 2.5 seconds of timeloss. After Petey throws a tornado, stand at his side so that he immediately turns to face you and opens his mouth.

### Petey Spam Sprays
#### Y-Cam Method
*Beginner*  
Simply Y-Cam, then spray, then spam spray after to both exit Y-Cam and finish filling Petey. This is slower, but can be more consistent for some players.

#### Backflip Method
*Intermediate*  
It takes 2 full spam sprays to fill Petey’s mouth (go for 3 to be safe in case you partially miss). If you’re having trouble, focusing on having two properly timed spam sprays can help you become more consistent with the timing. Start your backflip when Petey is almost finished turning, so that you are near the top of his head as he opens it to maximize your window for spam sprays.
