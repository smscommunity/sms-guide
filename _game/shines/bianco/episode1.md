# Bianco 1
Bianco 1 is an optional shine with an intended skip to Bianco 2 by the developers, and is collected in non-Any% categories like 79, 96, and 120 Shines. If you are new to Any%, you should be skipping this shine.  

#### 79/96 Shines  
- Waterslide down the hill as normal in Bianco 2
- Hover as you fall off the end of the slide (delaying the hover and keeping it shorter is faster), and double jump off the log
- Triplejump off the grass platform and hover as you reach the white wall
- Turn your angle to the right when you hover and dive rollout off the wall
- Hoverslide when you land, then rollout over the goop, pressing Y slightly after to enter Y-Cam
- Spray the Gatekeeper, backflip after ~2.5s
- After the cutscene, spam spray as soon as possible (unless you are too close) then fight the plant as normal
- After the 3rd hit, clear some goop and stand farther away
- Right when you see the white smoke appear from the plant dying, start watersliding straight towards it
- Jumpdive, rollout, and spinjump dive into the shine

<i><b>This is where the strat changes from 79/96</b>  
- Run past the plant, then do a spinjump towards [this platform](https://i.imgur.com/XzDC7JB.png) and delay your spray until the plant opens his mouth (you can't see the plant, so this is a feel thing)
- Land on the wooden platform, turn around and Y-Cam, and spray the plant again.
- Right when you spray, get out of Y-Cam and jumpdive towards [this blue coin](https://i.imgur.com/qKvQJd8.png)
- Jumpdive again out of the water and start spamming B to descend towards the coin
- Grab the coin before the cutscene starts
- Jumpdive, rollout, jumpdive, rollout, and jump and groundpound under the shine
