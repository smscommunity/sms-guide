# Honey Skip
*( guide by **Metacor** and **shoutplenty** â€“ [original](https://pastebin.com/T2z8zWtc) / [gist](https://gist.github.com/Metacor/6392df6b11599370f479f87f4df5431d) )*  

**Honey Skip** is a balancing act between:
* How far forward you are
* How far left/right you are
* How high you hover

Generally:
* The more right you are, the higher you want to hover
* The more forward you are, the lower you want to hover

**Visual Cues**  
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PuAXaH4.png" width="600">  
* **Down Arrow**: The Brick next to the dark wall decoration should be atleast ~half way in view  
    *[Weegee's Visual Cue Video](https://youtu.be/toVzSQ1fLbg?t=184)*
* **Side Arrows**: Pointing to 2 dark spots on the wall used as visual cues for when to stop hover  
    *These might be very hard (or impossible) to see on some CRT setups ([example](https://i.imgur.com/RlWu1BA.png))*  
* **Small Red Lines**: Showing ~equal distance between the white line on the left, and the wall on the right
* **Large Red Line**: Showing a potential alternative visual cue for some setups

If we use the bottom of the lower dark spot as 0%, and the top of the higher dark spot as 100%
then using different positions - we can get a range of %'s where Honey Skip will work

**Setups**: Try to be as close to the wall as possible, while still having Mario's shadow showing *(click for pictures)*
* [Left Most](https://i.imgur.com/mUdkDWo.jpg): This is nearly pixel perfect, you need to hover until the top of the lower dark spot   
    *if you're too far forward, this spot may be impossible*
* [Half Brick](https://i.imgur.com/SSe508R.jpg): works from -10% *(below the lower dark spot)* to 50% *(half way between the two)*
* [3/4th Brick](https://i.imgur.com/hfjpznb.jpg): works from 0% *(bottom of lower dark spot)* to 90% *(bottom of the top dark spot)*
* [Right Most](https://i.imgur.com/2RQMMWD.jpg): works from 10% *(top of the lower dark spot)* to 80% *(slightly below the top dark spot)*

**If you're too far forward *(tested ~1 pixel away from death plane)*;**  
hover ~5% lower than you normally would for that spot, BUT not below the lower dark spot  
*if you're too far left, it may be impossible to get honey skip, but you can be as far right
as you want - as long as you're not clipped out of the building, it should still work*


**Ideal setup** - *after clipping into the building:*
* Walk Mario forward until his shadow is showing  
* Position Mario roughly in the middle of the white line to the left, and the wall to the right  
    *too far left doesn't work and too far right has the chance of clipping out*
* Hover until you're slightly above the lower dark spot (about 20% to 25% works in nearly all scenarios)  
* Press X to switch Nozzles - *this will instantly stop your Hover*  
    *This is more consistent than just letting go of Hover, and is required to sidestep anyway*
* Press and Hold L to Groundpound as soon as possible after the X input  
    *Holding L will allow you to sidestep into the cutscene after the Groundpound*
* Hold Left after the Groundpound until Mario dies  
    *earliest 1 frame after GP animation starts, latest 1 frame before landing lag ends*
