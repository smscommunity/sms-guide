# Corona Mountain
The last level in the game, and a difficult one at that. Fire and spike platforms, along with a janky boat near the end; finishing the level off with rocket storage (you do not want to deal with the clouds).  

#### Normal Corona 
*Beginner*  
Something to note, in this IL normally people don't do what is called "Kwan dive" at the blue coin platform 17-18 seconds in. Instead, people typically do a spraying triplejump here.
